We're leaving together
But still it's farewell
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all
With so many light years to go
And thing to be found
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so
It's the final countdown

We're heading for Venus
And still we stand tall
'Cause maybe they've seen us
And welcome us all
